## Description 
This application is a readme generator made to make the process of creating a readme file for your project simple and easy. Simply follow the questions in node and at the end you will be presented with a brand new readme file. This project taught me how to use node and how to generate markdown files or other files if needed.
## Installation
To generate a readme file you have to git clone my repo to your local. You will then run npm install to install the required packages for this project. Then to start you will run node index.js and answer the prompts from the command line. Once all the prompts are answered it will generate a readme file that will be ready to use.
